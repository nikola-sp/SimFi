MAXIMUM EXCURSION AND STOPPING TIME
RECORD-HOLDERS FOR THE 3x + 1 PROBLEM:
COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS
TOMAÂ´S OLIVEIRA E SILVA
Abstract. This paper presents some results concerning the search for initial
values to the so-called 3x+1 problem which give rise either to function iterates
that attain a maximum value higher than all function iterates for all smaller
initial values, or which have a stopping time higher than those of all smaller
initial values. Our computational results suggest that for an initial value of n,
the maximum value of the function iterates is bounded from above by n2f(n),
with f(n) either a constant or a very slowly increasing function of n. As a by-
product of this (exhaustive) search, which was performed up to n = 3 Â· 253 â‰ˆ
2.702 Â· 1016, the 3x + 1 conjecture was verified up to that same number.
1. Introduction
The 3x + 1 problem, also known as the Collatz problem, is concerned with the
behavior of the iterates of the function T (n) : N0 ! N0 dened by
T (n) =
(
n/2 if n is even,
(3n + 1)/2 if n is odd.
(N0 denotes the set of non-negative integers.) The 3x + 1 conjecture asserts that
repeated iteration of T (n), starting from any positive integer n, eventually produces
the value 1 [3]. This easily stated conjecture has not yet been proved (or disproved).
To prove it, one has to prove that the iterates1 T (k)(n) of T (n) remain bounded
for each n > 0, and that the only solutions in the positive integers of the equation
n = T (k)(n) are k even, and n = 1 or n = 2. A very good account on the history of
the 3x + 1 problem, as well as a large collection of known results and conjectures
related to it, can be found in [3]. We will follow the notation and terminology of
that paper whenever possible.
The trajectory of n is the sequence

. The stopping time of n, de-
noted by Ïƒ(n), is the least positive k for which T (k)(n) < n, if it exists, or innity,
otherwise. The maximum excursion of the trajectory of n, denoted by t(n), is the
maximum value of T (k)(n) for k  0, if it exists, or innity, otherwise. We call
n > 1 a Ïƒ-record-holder if Ïƒ(m) < Ïƒ(n) for all 1 < m < n, i.e., if all integers
smaller than n (and larger than 1) have smaller stopping times. Similarly, we call

n a t-record-holder if t(m) < t(n) for all 1 < m < n. The main objective of this
paper is to nd all t-record-holders in the interval 1 < n < 3  253, with the purpose
of studying empirically the rate of growth of t(n). As a side result, we also check
the 3x+ 1 conjecture, and nd all Ïƒ-record-holders, in the same range. The results
of a previous search, conducted by Leavens and Vermeulen, broader in scope but
on a smaller range (5.6  1013), are reported in [4].
Equipped with these denitions, the 3x + 1 conjecture states that every integer
n  2 has a nite stopping time (which implies that t(n) < 1 for all n  2). This
alternative formulation of the 3x + 1 conjecture rests on the observation that if it
is known that all trajectories for n < n0 reach the value 1 after a nite number
of iterates, then, to prove the same for n0, it is enough to iterate T at n0 until
T (k)(n0) < n0, i.e., up to k = Ïƒ(n0).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe some in-
teresting facts about the structure of the iterates of T (n). These facts are exploited
in section 3, and lead to the construction of an ecient algorithm to search exhaus-
tively for t- and Ïƒ-record-holders. The results of this exhaustive search are reported
in section 4, and provide numerical evidence for a conjecture, stated in section 5,
concerning the growth of t(n). Subsection 4.1 provides a theoretical analysis of the
speedup of the proposed search algorithm over a \naive" search algorithm.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the theoretical results reported in this paper
were (re)discovered by the author. Quite probably, most of them, if not all, are
common knowledge in the 3x + 1 research community.
2. On the structure of the iterates of T (n)
Our rst task is to show that it is possible to determine, using only the last k
base-2 digits of n0, which branches of T (n) will be taken in the computation of
T (k)(n0). For k = 1 this is an immediate consequence of the denition of T (n), and
is put is evidence by setting n0 = 2n1 + r0, where r0 is the last base-2 digit of n0.
In fact, applying T (n) to n0 gives
T (n0) = T (2n1 + r0) =
(
n1 if r0 = 0,
3n1 + 2 if r0 = 1.
It is also clear that we can compute T (2)(n0) directly, by setting n1 = 2n2 + r1,
where r1 is the last base-2 digit of n1 (and therefore the next to last base-2 digit
of n0). A few simple computations yield
T (2)(n0) =
8>>><>>>:
n2 if r0 = 0 and r1 = 0, i.e., if n0 = 4n2 + 0,
3n2 + 2 if r0 = 0 and r1 = 1, i.e., if n0 = 4n2 + 2,
3n2 + 1 if r0 = 1 and r1 = 0, i.e., if n0 = 4n2 + 1,
9n2 + 8 if r0 = 1 and r1 = 1, i.e., if n0 = 4n2 + 3.
It is possible to proceed in the same fashion to compute T (k)(n0) for all positive k.
The fate of each new iterate requires the knowledge of one more base-2 digit of n0.
Let n0 = 2knk + mk, with2 nk = bn0/2kc and mk = n0 mod 2k. We claim that
Property 1. The general form of T (k)(n) is

where y(k; n0) is the number of odd branches of T (n) that were taken in the com-
putation of T (k)(n0) [or of T (k)(mk)].
This result is clearly true for k = 0, 1, and 2. For the general case, it can be
proven easily by induction, with the help of the formulas nk = 2nk+1 + rk and
mk+1 = rk2k + mk, where rk is the last base-2 digit of nk. In fact, applying these
formulas to (1), and also using (1) to simplify the result, gives
T (k)(n0) = 2  3y(k;n0)nk+1 + T (k)(mk+1).(2)
The computation of T
(
T (k)(n0)

then shows that if (1) is valid up to a certain k
then it is also valid for k + 1, thereby proving our claim. Note that
y(k + 1; n0) = y(k + 1; mk+1) =
(
y(k; n0) if T (k)(mk+1) is even,
y(k; n0) + 1 if T (k)(mk+1) is odd.
Our next task is to show that the result of the k-th iteration of T (n) can be
naturally expressed in base-3, as suggested by (1). We claim that
Property 2. For k  0,
T (k)(mk) < 3y(k;mk).(3)
That is, T (k)(mk), when expressed in base-3, has no more that y(k; mk) digits.
Again, this is clearly true for k = 0, 1, and 2. Once again, the general case can be
proven easily by induction. Assuming that (3) is true up to a certain k allows us
to conclude that
T (k)(mk+1) = 3y(k;n0)rk + T (k)(mk) < 2  3y(k;n0).
It is then a simple matter to verify that (3) is also true for k + 1, proving our
claim. In words, properties 1 and 2 state that the representation of T (k)(n0) in
base-3 is very simple: the last y(k; n0) digits are given by T (k)(mk), and the rest
by nk [cf. (1) and (3)]. This is illustrated in Figure 1, where it is shown pictorially
that the computations leading to T (k)(n0), for an arbitrary non-negative n0, are
naturally organized in a binary tree.
Our nal task is to explain some additional structure that we have noticed in the
iterates of T (n). Generalizing the ideas that led to (2), it is not dicult to verify
that

Concerning the relative order of the iterates of T (n), we have observed numeri-
cally that

Figure 1. This tree describes the results of iterating T (n) k-times,
0  k  5. The node depth is equal to the number of iterates of
T (n). Inside each node (oval box), the number in the left-hand
side is n0 (expressed in base-2), and the number in the right-hand
side is T (k)(n0) (expressed in base-3). To conserve space, inside
each node nk was replaced by just n.
in increasing order, then the corresponding numbers
T (p)(mk), 0  p  minfk, Ïƒ(mk)g,
also become sorted in increasing order.3
This property implies that
Property 5. If 1  k  40, 1 < mk < 2k, and nk  0, then the relative order of
the numbers T (p)(mk) is the same as that of the numbers T (p)(2k  nk + mk) for
0  p  minfk, Ïƒ(mk)g.
This implies that the maximum (and the minimum) of the rst k  40 iterates
occurs, for each 1 < mk < 2k and for all nk  0, always in the same iterate number.
A simple consequence of property 5, which follows from the comparison of the p-th
iterate of 2k  nk + mk with the 0-th iterate, is
Property 6. Let Ïƒ(mk) = p  k  40 and 1 < mk < 2k. Then, the stopping time
of the trajectory of 2k  nk + mk, for any nk  0, is exactly equal to p.
3To reduce the computational effort, we have restricted the verification of this property to the
upper bound min{k, Ïƒ(mk)} and to k â‰¤ 40. (The reason for this will become apparent later on.)
We conjecture that it remains true for k > 40, and that it can be extended to p > Ïƒ(mk), as long
as T (p)(mk) > 1.

T - AND Ïƒ-RECORD-HOLDERS FOR THE 3x + 1 PROBLEM 375
The two congruence classes not treated in property 6, viz. mk = 0 and mk = 1,
are special. The rst one gives rise either to a cycle of period one, if k = 1 and
nk = 0, or to a trajectory with a stopping time equal to one, if k > 0 and nk > 0
[recall that T (2n) = n]. The second one gives rise either to a cycle of period two,
if k = 2 and nk = 0, or to a trajectory with a stopping time equal to two, if k > 1
and nk > 0 [recall that T (2)(4n + 1) = 3n + 1]. We then have
Property 7. The stopping time of the trajectory of 2n, n > 0, is one, and the
stopping time of the trajectory of 4n + 1, n > 0, is two.
Note that properties 4, 6, and 7, taken together, conrm the coecient stopping
time conjecture [3, p. 11] for stopping times smaller than 41.
Figure 2. The search tree for 0  k  5. A small open circle ()
after a node indicates a cycle (for nk = 0). A small shaded circle
() after a node indicates that the stopping time for the congruence
class of initial values associated with that node is exactly equal to
that nodeâ€™s depth. These two types of nodes do not need to be
subdivided. Only the nodes with maximal depth (and without a
circle) are used in the search.
3. The exhaustive search strategy
Properties 6 and 7 are fundamental to our exhaustive search strategy. They allow
us to discard the ospring of all nodes of Figure 1 that satisfy T (k)(mk)  mk. All
nodes of the resultant (pruned) tree, which is depicted in Figure 2, are associated
with one of three cases:
1. The last iterate attained, for the rst time, a value lower than the initial value
of the trajectory (the nodeâ€™s depth is the stopping time for all initial trajectory
values belonging to the congruence class associated with that node). These
nodes are marked with a shaded circle, and do not need to be subdivided.
2. The last iterate reached, for nk = 0 (k is the depth of the node), a value equal
to the initial value of the trajectory (a cycle). These nodes are marked with
an open circle in Figure 2, and, for nk > 0, they behave as the nodes marked
with a shaded circle. Hence, they also do not need to be subdivided.
3. The maximal depth used in the tree construction was reached. The stop-
ping time for all initial trajectory values belonging to the congruence class
associated with nodes of this kind is larger that the maximal tree depth.
The nodes of type 1 or 2 above will be called closed nodes. All other nodes of the
tree will be called open nodes. The number of open and closed nodes at each depth
of the tree, denoted respectively by no(k) and nc(k), up to depth 40, are presented

in Table 1. In that table, we also present the ratios no(k)/2k and nc(k)/2k. The
latter gives us the densities of the trajectories with stopping time exactly equal
to k. The former gives us the density of trajectories with stopping time higher
than k [in the notation of [3], this density is given by 1 âˆ’ F (k)]. In the appendix,
we present a set of recurrence formulas to compute no(k) and nc(k). It produces
correct results provided property 4 is true up to (and including) k. In Figure 3 we
depict the graph of the base-10 logarithm of no(k)/2k = 1 âˆ’ F (k) as a function
of k, for k  100.

Figure 3. This linear{log graph depicts the ratio between open
nodes at depth k of the search tree, and the total number of nodes
(2k) at that same depth. Shaded circles () represent exact val-
ues (generated by our program), open circles () represent values

Theorem D of [3].
Our search strategy is to analyze only initial values that belong to congruence
classes corresponding to nodes of type 3. As Table 1 and Figure 3 demonstrate, to
reduce the density of these nodes, thus speeding up the search, one should use a
maximal tree depth as large as possible. In our program we have used a maximal
depth of 40. This depth is the largest one that can be used in the construction of
a pruned tree similar to that of Figure 2, without taking precautions against arith-
metic overflows in a machine with 64-bit registers (DEC Alpha). Since a maximal
depth this large gives rise to an enormous number of type 3 nodes | 6 402 835 000
to be exact | it is impractical to store and sort them in increasing order of their
corresponding congruence classes. This makes a sequential search infeasible.4 In-
stead, our program processes the congruence classes in the order in which they are
generated. Although this makes the program somewhat more complicated, this
method has the important advantage that it requires an insignicant amount of
memory.
To cope with the nonsequential search, the program maintains two lists, sorted by
the initial value of the trajectories: one for candidate t-record-holders, and another
for candidate Ïƒ-record-holders. To reduce drastically the overhead of managing
these two lists, the program analyzes 210 \consecutive" initial values belonging to
the congruence class of each type 3 node. Since these 210 values are tested in
increasing order, only one pass (per node) through these lists is required to update
them. In normal circumstances, these lists have less that 80 and 40 elements,
respectively.
Each type 3 node has associated with it three numbers: m40; T (40)(m40), which
is larger than m40; and y(40; m40). Since these numbers are available, it is sensible
4The search reported in [4] appears to use a sequential search, making use, among other things,
of a (sorted) pruned tree of depth 16.

to put them to good use. We do that by using property 1 to compute with very
little overhead T (40)(n40  240 + m40), thus avoiding the initial 40 iterates of T (n).
Note that, since the 210 values of n40 are consecutive, we only need to apply (1) for
the rst one, which requires one time-expensive multi-precision multiplication and
one time-inexpensive multi-precision addition. The remaining 210 âˆ’ 1 values only
require one (inexpensive) multi-precision addition each.
Our search strategy introduces two problems. The rst one is that Ïƒ-record-
holders with stopping times smaller than 41 are not reported. Since Ïƒ(27) = 59 >
40, the missing ones can be found very easily by testing all initial values between 2
and 27. A more serious problem occurs for t-record-holders. It is quite expensive
to compute, for each type 3 node, the maximum of the rst 40 iterates for its
congruence class (recall property 5). Since that information is important only
for small initial values, we have not done it. This has the implication that the
maximum excursion information for small initial values may be inaccurate, if that
maximum excursion occurs before the fortieth iterate. To generate the missing t-
record-holders, and to remove the wrong ones, we, a posteriori, analyzed the results
of the search. Let ck be the k-th candidate t-record-holder. Using the simple bound
T (k)(n)  3
k âˆ’ 1
2k âˆ’ 1 n,
it is clear that if
340 âˆ’ 1
240 âˆ’ 1 ck+1 < t(ck)
then there can be no t-record-holders between ck and ck+1 with a maximum ex-
cursion occurring in the rst 40 iterates. Based on this observation, we traversed
the candidate t-record-holders list looking for the last candidate that did not sat-
isfy this condition. We then analyzed all initial values smaller than the candidate
immediately following the last one found. It turned out that we had to analyze all
initial values smaller than 319 804 831. (As it happens, this number is rather con-
servative. The largest t-record-holder with a maximum excursion occurring before
the fortieth iterate is 704 511.)
There is one nal (and important) optimization that did not occur to us. We
found the idea, in a form more general than the one described here, in [4]. The idea
is to ignore initial values that belong to the trajectory of a smaller initial value (this
is a special case of the so-called trajectory coalescence). Consider, for example, the
trajectory of 2n + 1, which is (2n + 1, 3n + 2, . . . ). Since 3n + 2 > 2n + 1 for all
n  0, it is clear that 3n+ 2 cannot be a t- or a Ïƒ-record-holder. It is therefore not
necessary to analyze initial values congruent to 2 mod 3. The next interesting case
is based on the relation T (3)(8n + 3) = 9n + 4, which renders the analysis of initial
values congruent to 4 mod 9 unnecessary. Other cases of this sort can be found by
iterating several times the inverse function Tâˆ’1(n), with an initial value belonging
to each one of the congruence classes modulo 3k, and looking for an inverse iterate
smaller that the initial value. The congruence classes for which this happens will be
called closed. Table 2 presents the number of closed congruence classes modulo 3k
for 1  k  10. Unfortunately, the percentage of closed congruence classes increases
very slowly with k. Thus, there is hardly any advantage in using congruent classes
modulo 3k with a \large" k. In our program we have used k = 2, which excludes
4/9 of all initial values, and requires a very small amount of memory to implement.

4. Computational results
We have coded a program that implements all the techniques described in the
previous section. All multi-precision arithmetic was performed on numbers stored
in two 64-bit registers. The program was coded entirely in C. The function T (n)
was implemented with a multi-precision version of the code
if(n & 1)
n += (n >> 1) + 1;
else
n >>= 1;
which avoids a time consuming multiplication by 3. The test to update the max-
imum excursion was placed inside the if part of the code, together with a test
to detect arithmetic overflows. The stopping condition for the iterations was
T (k)(n) < n, and was placed inside the else part of the code. Note that the
existence of a cycle would put the program into an endless loop, which did not
happen.
It turned out that the idea of using (1) to do several iterates of T (n) in one step
did not bring any speed advantage. This was due to the time-consuming multi-
precision multiplication it requires, to the large amount of memory required to
implement it, to the extra time required to test for a possible maximum excursion,
and to the extra time required to test the stopping condition T (k)(n) < n. Remark-
ably, the same idea was used with success in [4], being responsible for a program
speedup factor of 7.
One important feature of our program is that its working set (\active" code and
data) ts nicely into the processorâ€™s on-chip caches. Each run of the program tests
exhaustively an interval of 240+10 initial values, and takes around 6 CPU weeks on
a DEC Alpha 266MHz computer. We have used 4 DEC Alpha computers during
the search, two 266MHz models and two older 133MHz models, each one testing a
dierent range. The results of the search are presented in Tables 3 and 4. These
results, up to 5.6 1013 for t-record-holders, and up to 6.8 1012 for Ïƒ-record-holders,
are in perfect accord with the results reported in [4].
For the record, our search program tests, on the average, an interval of about
317 million integers each second (on a DEC Alpha 266MHz machine, and with the
program written entirely in C).

The computer search reported in this paper, which took approximately 4 CPU
years, is still running. Please contact the author for the latest results.
4.1. Theoretical analysis of the search speedup. It is instructive to estimate
the speedup of the program with respect to what we call a naive search. In a naive
search, all initial values are tested, sequentially, to check if they are a t- or a Ïƒ-
record-holder (or both). As explained before, it is sucient to iterate T at n until
T (k)(n) < n. Thus, the number of iterates performed for each initial value is equal
to its stopping time. The average stopping time is given by the formula
Ïƒnaive =
1X
k=1
k
nc(k)
2k
.
This number can be estimated using the data of Table 1, extended by the output
of the recurrence formulas reported in the appendix. Performing the necessary
computations gives the estimate
Ïƒnaive  3.493,
License or copyright restrictions may apply to redistribution; see http://www.ams.org/journal-terms-of-use
382 TOMAÂ´S OLIVEIRA E SILVA
which agrees very well with empirical data. On the other hand, the average number
of iterates required to test each initial value belonging to one of the congruence
classes associated with the open nodes at depth 40 of the search tree is
Ïƒ40 =
240
no(40)
1X
k=41
(k âˆ’ 40) nc(k)
2k
(recall that the rst 40 iterates are done almost for free), which gives the estimate
Ïƒ40  18.674.
This estimate also agrees very well with empirical data. The search speedup is thus
240
no(40)
Ïƒnaive
Ïƒ40
 32.118.
It remains to analyze the speedup due to the nal optimization discussed in
section 3 (trajectory coalescence). Since gcd(2k, 3p) = 1 for all k, p  0, the integers
belonging to one of the congruence classes modulo 2k (3p) are distributed uniformly
among the congruence classes modulo 3p (2k). In particular, the 210 initial values
n40 240+m40 that are tested for each type 3 node are distributed (almost) uniformly
among the congruence classes modulo 9. We claim that the average number of
iterates required to test the initial values belonging to one of these 9 congruence
classes is the same for all 9 congruence classes. This follows from the observation
that the numbers n40 which make n0 belong to a given congruence class modulo 9
are uniformly distributed among the congruence classes modulo a power of 2. This
forces the average number of iterates for each congruence class modulo 9 to be
equal to that of any other congruence class (recall that the pruned tree involves
the distribution of initial values among congruence classes modulo powers of 2).
From this argument we conclude that the trajectory coalescence optimization is, in
theory, completely independent of all previous optimizations, and so it introduces
an extra speedup factor of 9/5 (only 5 of the 9 congruence classes modulo 9 need
to be tested). This gives a total speedup factor of approximately 57.813.
The speedup factor just given disregards the extra time required to manage
each one of the searches (the naive and ours), as well as the extra time required
to identify the two types of record-holders. Since the average number of iterates
required to test each initial value in the naive search is rather small, the (small)
time required to test for t- and Ïƒ-record-holders may have a signicant impact on
the program speed. On the other hand, our search algorithm was designed to make
these overheads small with respect to the time required to iterate T (n) Ïƒ40 times
(on the average). For example, the entire search tree can be generated in around
one hour (on a DEC Alpha 266MHz machine), which is less than 0.1% of the total
search time. The code that manages the two record-holder lists also contributes
with a small fraction to the total search time. A direct comparison of the search
times of the two algorithms gave a speedup of around 67, which shows that in our
programs the overheads are considerably more signicant in the naive search.
5. Concluding remarks
The main purpose of the search was to analyze the growth of the function t(n).
Figure 4 displays a graph with all t-record-holders, and their respective maximum
excursions, found in the search. This gure suggests the following.

Conjecture 1. The maximum excursion t(n) satisfies
t(n) < n2 f(n),
where f(n) is either a constant or a very slowly increasing function of n.
With the data we have available it is not clear if f(n) is, or isnâ€™t, a constant.
In fact, t(n) > n2 occurs for only seven t-record-holders for n < 3  253, and in all
cases found to date t(n) < 8n2. This conjecture is in accord with theoretical results
concerning the maximum excursions of a stochastic model of the 3x+1 problem [2].
For completeness, Figure 5 displays a graph with all Ïƒ-record-holders found in
the search, together with their respective stopping times. Unfortunately, the growth
of the stopping times of Ïƒ-record-holders appears to be somewhat more erratic than
the growth of the maximum excursion of t-record-holders. Nevertheless, Figure 5

shows that the stopping times of Ïƒ-record-holders appear to increase more or less
linearly with the logarithm of the trajectory starting value. Given the average
behavior of the stopping time, that was to be expected.
An important side result of our search is the verication of the 3x+1 conjecture
up to n = 3  253  2.702  1016. This upper limit can be used to improve the lower
bound on the length of nontrivial cycles of T (n) given in [1].

Appendix
In this appendix we present simple recurrence formulas to compute no(k) and
nc(k). It turns out that it is very convenient to break no(k) into smaller terms. Let
no(k, p), 0  p  k, be the number of open nodes at depth k for which y(k; mk) = p.
Clearly, no(0, 0) = 1, and no(k) =
Pk
p=0 no(k, p). When an open node at depth
kâˆ’1, k > 0, is subdivided, one of the two nodes it generates will satisfy y(k, mk) =
y(k âˆ’ 1, mkâˆ’1), and the other one will satisfy y(k, mk) = y(k âˆ’ 1, mkâˆ’1) + 1. If
all the nodes generated by this process were open nodes, this would imply that
no(k, p) = no(kâˆ’ 1, pâˆ’ 1)+ no(kâˆ’ 1, p), with the assumption that no(kâˆ’ 1,âˆ’1) =
no(k âˆ’ 1, k) = 0, giving a binomial distribution for no(k, p). However, some of the
nodes generated may be closed nodes. Assuming that property 4 holds for all k,
this happens when 3p < 2k. Therefore we have, for k > 0,
no(k, p) =
(
0 if 3p < 2k,
no(k âˆ’ 1, pâˆ’ 1) + no(k âˆ’ 1, p) if 3p > 2k.
Dening nc(k, p) in the same way as no(k, p) we also have
nc(k, p) =
(
no(k âˆ’ 1, p) if 3p < 2k,
0 if 3p > 2k.
(Actually, at most one of the numbers nc(k, p) may be non-zero.) Knowing no(k, p)
and nc(k, p), it is a trivial task to compute no(k) and nc(k). These recurrence
formulas were veried with a computer for k  40.
