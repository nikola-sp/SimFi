that attain a maximum value higher than all function iterates for all smaller
initial values, or which have a stopping time higher than those of all smaller
initial values. Our computational results suggest that for an initial value of n,
the maximum value of the function iterates is bounded from above by n2f(n),
with f(n) either a constant or a very slowly increasing function of n. As a by-

21 Introduction
The 3x+1 Problem is perhaps today‚Äôs most enigmatic unsolved mathematical
problem: it can be explained to child who has learned how to divide by 2
and multiply by 3, yet there are relatively few strong results toward solving it.
Paul Erdo¬®s was correct when he stated, ‚ÄúMathematics is not ready for such
problems.‚Äù
The problem is also referred to as the 3n+1 problem and is associated with
the names of Collatz, Hasse, Kakutani, Ulam, Syracuse, and Thwaites. It may
be stated in a variety of ways. Defining the Collatz function as
C(x) =
Ô£±Ô£≤
Ô£≥ 3x + 1 x ‚â° 1 (mod 2)x
2 x ‚â° 0 (mod 2),
the conjecture states that for each m ‚àà Z+, there is a k ‚àà Z+ such that
C(k)(m) = 1, that is, any positive integer will eventually iterate to 1. Note that
an odd number m iterates to 3m + 1 which then iterates to (3m + 1)/2. One
may therefore ‚Äúcompress‚Äù the dynamics by considering the map
T (x) =
Ô£±Ô£≤
Ô£≥
3x+1
2 x ‚â° 1 (mod 2)
x
2 x ‚â° 0 (mod 2).
The map T is usually favored in the literature.
To a much lesser extent some authors work with the most dynamically
streamlined 3x + 1 function, F : Z+
odd
‚Üí Z+
odd
, defined by
F (x) =
3x + 1
2m(3x+1)
where m(x) equals the number of factors of 2 contained in 3x+1. While working
with F allows one to work only on the odd positive integers, the variability of
m seems to prohibit any substantial analysis.
This survey reflects the author‚Äôs view of how work on this problem can
be structured. I owe a huge debt to Jeff Lagarias and Gu¬®nther Wirsching for
the important work they have done in bringing this problem forward. The
paper of Lagarias[45](1985) thoroughly catalogued earlier results, made copious
3connections, and developed many new lines of attack; it has justly become the
classical reference for this problem. Wirsching‚Äôs book [87](1998) begins with
a strong survey, followed by several chapters of his own noteworthy analysis.
Lagarias has also maintained an annotated bibliography [48](1998) of work on
this problem, another valuable resource. This current survey would have been
much more difficult to write in the absence of these significant contributions.
This survey is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather is complementary to
the work of Lagarias and Wirsching. Where I believed there was significant new
work in a given area, I included earlier contributions for the sake of completeness.
Some areas which have not seen recent development, such as the interesting
work connected to functional equations, cellular automata, and the origin of
the problem, have not been mentioned; the reader may consult Wirsching‚Äôs
book [87](1998).
2 Numerical Investigations and Stopping Time
The structure of the positive integers forces any orbit of T to iterate to one of
the following:
1. the trivial cycle {1, 2}
2. a non-trivial cycle
3. infinity (the orbit is divergent)
The 3x + 1 Problem claims that option 1 occurs in all cases. Oliveira e
Silva[61, 62](1999,2000) proved that this holds for all numbers n < 100√ó 250 ‚âà
1.12 √ó 1017. This was accomplished with two 133MHz and two 266MHz DEC
Alpha computers and using 14.4 CPU years. This computation ended in April
2000. Roosendaal[65](2003) claims to have improved this to n = 195 √ó 250 ‚âà
2.19 √ó 1017. His calculations continue, with the aid of many others in this
distributed-computer project.
The record for proving the non-existence of non-trivial cycles is that any
such cycle must have length no less than 272,500,658. This was derived with
4the help of numerical results like those in the last paragraph coupled with the
theory of continued fractions ‚Äì see a section 5 for more on cycles.
There is a natural algorithm for checking that all numbers up to some N
iterate to one. First, check that every positive integer up to N ‚àí 1 iterates to
one, then consider the iterates of N . Once the iterates go below N , you are
done. For this reason, one considers the so-called stopping time of n, that is,
the number of steps needed to iterate below n :
œÉ(n) = inf{k : T (k)(n) < n}.
Related to this is the total stopping time, the number of steps needed to iterate
to 1:
œÉ‚àû(n) = inf{k : T (k)(n) = 1}.
One considers the height of n, namely, the highest point to which n iterates:
h(n) = sup{T (k)(n) : k ‚àà Z+}.
Note that if n is in a divergent trajectory, then œÉ‚àû(n) = h(n) = ‚àû. These
functions may be surprisingly large even for small values of n. For example,
œÉ(27) = 59, œÉ‚àû(27) = 111, h(27) = 9232.
The orbit of 27 is depicted in Figure 1.
Roosendaal[65](2003) has computed various ‚Äúrecords‚Äù for these functions1.
Various results about consecutive numbers with the same height are catalogued
by Wirsching[87, pp.21‚Äì22](1998).
2.1 Stopping Time
The natural algorithm mentioned earlier can be rephrased: the 3x + 1 problem
is true if and only if every positive integer has a finite stopping time. Terras[77,
1Roosdendaal has different names for these functions, and he applies them to the map
C(x).

678](1976,1979) has proven that the set of positive integers with finite stopping
time has density one. Specifically, he showed that the limit
F (k) := lim
m‚Üí‚àû
1
m
|{n ‚â§ m : œÉ(n) ‚â§ k}|
exists for each k ‚àà Z+ and limk‚Üí‚àû F (k) = 1. A shorter proof was provided
by Everett[31](1977). Lagarias[45](1985) proved a result regarding the speed of
convergence:
F (k) ‚â• 1‚àí 2‚àíŒ∑k
for all k ‚àà Z+, where Œ∑ = 1‚àíH(Œ∏), H(x) = ‚àíx log(x) ‚àí (1‚àí x) log(1‚àí x) and
Œ∏ = (log2 3)
‚àí1. He uses this to constrain any possible divergent orbits:
‚à£‚à£{n ‚àà Z+ : n ‚â§ x, œÉ(n) = ‚àû}‚à£‚à£ ‚â§ c1x1‚àíŒ∑
for some positive constant c1. This implies that any divergent trajectory cannot
diverge too slowly. Along these lines, Garcia and Tal[33](1999) have recently
proven that the density of any divergent orbit is zero. This result holds for more
general sets and more general maps.
Along different lines, Venturini[81](1989) showed that for every œÅ > 0, the set
{n ‚àà Z+ : T (k)(n) < œÅn for some k} has density one. Allouche[1](1979) showed
that {n ‚àà Z+ : T (k)(n) < nc for some k} has density one for c > 3/2‚àí log2 3 ‚âà
0.869. This was improved by Korec[39](1994) who obtained the same result
with c > log4 3 ‚âà 0.7924.
Not surprisingly, results of a probabilistic nature abound concerning these
3x + 1 functions. An assumption often made is that after many iterations, the
next iterate has an equal chance of being either even or odd. Wagon[84](1985)
argues that the average stopping time for odd n (with the function C(x)) ap-
proaches a constant, specifically, the number
‚àû‚àë
i=1
[1 + 2i + i log2 3]
ci
2[i log2 3]
‚âà 9.477955
where ci is the number of sequences containing 3/2 and 1/2 with exactly i 3/2‚Äôs
such that the product of the whole sequence is less than 1, but the product
7of any initial sequence is greater than 1. Note that this formula bypasses the
pesky ‚Äú+1‚Äù, perhaps justified asymptotically. This seems to be borne out in
Wagon‚Äôs numerical testing of stopping times for odd numbers up to n = 109,
which matches well with the approximation given above.
2.2 Total Stopping Time
Results regarding the total stopping time are also plenteous. Applegate and
Lagarias[9](2002) make use of two new auxiliary functions: the stopping time
ratio
Œ≥(n) :=
œÉ‚àû(n)
log n
,
and the ones-ratio œÅ(n) for convergent sequences, defined as the ratio of the
number of odd terms in the first œÉ‚àû(n) iterates divided by œÉ‚àû(n). It is easy
to see that Œ≥(n) ‚â• 1/ log 2 for all n, with equality only when n = 2k. Stronger
inequalities are
Œ≥(n) ‚â• 1
log 2‚àí œÅ(n) log 3
for any convergent trajectory, while if œÅ(n) ‚â§ 0.61, then for any positive ,
Œ≥(n) ‚â§ 1
log 2‚àí œÅ(n) log 3 + 
for all sufficiently large n. If one assumes that the ones-ratio equals 1/2 (which is
equivalent to the equal probability of encountering an even or an odd after many
iterates), we have that the average value of Œ≥(n) is 2/ log(4/3) ‚âà 6.95212, as
has been observed by Shanks[69](1965), Crandall[26](1978), Lagarias[45](1985),
Rawsthorne[64](1985), Lagarias and Weiss[47](1992), and Borovkov and Pfeifer[15](2000).
Experimental evidence supports this observation. Compare this with the upper
bounds suggested by the stochastic models of Lagarias and Weiss[47](1992):
lim sup
n‚Üí‚àû
Œ≥(n) ‚âà 41.677647.
Applegate and Lagarias[9](2002) note from records of Roosendaal[65](2003)
what is apparently the largest known value of Œ≥:
n = 7, 219, 136, 416, 377, 236, 271, 195
8produces œÉ‚àû(n) = 1848 and Œ≥(n) ‚âà 36.7169. Applegate and Lagarias seek a
lower bound for Œ≥ which holds infinitely often. Using the well-known fact that
T (k)(2k ‚àí 1) = 3k ‚àí 1 (see, for example, Kuttler[44](1994)), they note that
Œ≥(2k ‚àí 1) ‚â• log 2 + log 3
(log 2)2
‚âà 3.729.
They go on to show that there are infinitely many converging n whose ones-ratio
is at least 14/29, hence giving the lower bound
Œ≥(n) ‚â• 29
29 log 2‚àí 14 log 3 ‚âà 6.14316
for infinitely many n. Though the proof involves an extensive computational
search on the Collatz tree to depth 60, the authors note with surprise that the
probabilistic average of Œ≥(n) ‚Äì approximately 6.95212 ‚Äì was not attained.
Roosendaal[65](2003) defines a function which he calls the residue of a num-
ber x ‚àà Z+, denoted Res(x). Suppose x is a convergent C-trajectory with E
even terms and O odd terms before reaching one. Then the residue is defined
as
Res(x) :=
2E
x3O
.
Roosendall notes that Res(993) = 1.253142 . . ., and that this is the highest
residue attained for all x < 232. He conjectures that this holds for all x ‚àà Z+.
Zarnowski[89](2001) recasts the 3x + 1 problem as one with Markov chains.
Let g be the slightly altered function
g(x) =
Ô£±Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≤
Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≥
3x+1
2 x ‚â° 1 (mod 2), x > 1

en the column vector whose n
th entry is one and all other entries zero, and the
transition matrix P be defined by
Pij =

that attain a maximum value higher than all function iterates for all smaller
initial values, or which have a stopping time higher than those of all smaller
initial values. Our computational results suggest that for an initial value of n,
the maximum value of the function iterates is bounded from above by n2f(n),
with f(n) either a constant or a very slowly increasing function of n. As a by-
product of this (exhaustive) search, which was performed up to n = 3 √Ç¬∑ 253 √¢‚Ä∞ÀÜ
2.702 √Ç¬∑ 1016, the 3x + 1 conjecture was verified up to that same number.
1. Introduction
The 3x + 1 problem, also known as the Collatz problem, is concerned with the
behavior of the iterates of the function T (n) : N0 ! N0 dened by
Ô£≥ 1 if g(i) = j,0 otherwise.
This gives a correspondence between g(k)(n) and eTnP
k, and the 3x+1 Problem

where 1 and 0 represent constant column vectors. Zarnowski goes on to show
that the structure of a certain generalized inverse X of I ‚àí P encodes the total
stopping times of Z+.

Dumont and Reiter[29].
2.3 The Collatz Graph and Predecessor Sets
The topic of stopping times is intricately linked with the Collatz tree or Collatz
graph, the directed graph whose vertices are predecessors of one via the map T .
It is depicted in Figure 2.3.
The structure of the Collatz graph has attracted some attention. Andaloro[4](2002)
studied results about the connectedness of subsets of the Collatz graph. Urvoy[79](2000)
10
proved that the Collatz graph is non-regular, in the sense that it does not have
a decidable monadic second order theory; this is related to the work of Conway
mentioned in Section 4.
Instead of analyzing how fast iterates approach one, one may consider the
set of numbers which approach a given number a, that is, the predecessor set of
a:
PT (a) := {b ‚àà Z+ : T (k)(b) = a for some k ‚àà Z+}
Since such sets are obviously infinitely large, one may measure those terms in
the predecessor set not exceeding a given bound x, that is,
Za(x) := |{n ‚àà PT (a) : n ‚â§ x}|.
The size of Za(x) was first studied by Crandall[26](1979), who proved the exis-
tence of some c > 0 such that
Z1(x) > x
c, x sufficiently large.
Wirsching[87, p.4](1998) notes that this result extends to Za(x) for all a 6‚â°
0 mod 3. Using the tree-search method of Crandall, Sander[67](1990) gave a spe-
cific lower bound, c = 0.25, and Applegate and Lagarias[6](1995) extended this
to c = 0.643. Using functional difference inequalities, Krasikov[41](1989) intro-
duced a different approach and obtained c = 3/7 ‚âà 0.42857. Wirsching[85](1993)
used the same approach to obtain c = 0.48. Applegate and Lagarias[7](1995)
superseded these results with Z1(x) > x
0.81, for sufficiently large x, by enhanc-
ing Krasikov‚Äôs approach with nonlinear programming. Recently, Krasikov and
Lagarias[42](2002) streamlined this approach to obtain
Z1(x) > x
0.84, x sufficiently large.
Wirsching[87](1998) has pushed these types of results in a different direction.
On a seemingly different course, for j, k ‚àà Z+ let Rj,k denote the set of all sums
of the form
2Œ±0 + 2Œ±13 + 2Œ±232 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑+ 2Œ±j 3j
11
where j + k ‚â• Œ±0 > ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ > Œ±j ‚â• 0. The size of Rj,k satisfies
|Rj,k| =
Ô£´
Ô£≠ j + k + 1
j + 1
Ô£∂
Ô£∏ .
To maximize the size, one has |Rj‚àí1,j | = (2jj ). Wirsching posed the following
‚Äúcovering conjecture‚Äù: there is a constant K > 0 such that for every j, l ‚àà Z+
we have the implication
|Rj‚àí1,j | ‚â• K ¬∑2 ¬∑3l‚àí1 =‚áí Rj‚àí1,j covers the prime residue classes to modulus 3l.
This conjecture implies a stronger version of the earlier inequalities:
lim inf
x‚Üí‚àû
(
inf
a6‚â°0 mod 3
Za(ax)
xŒ¥
)
> 0 for any Œ¥ ‚àà (0, 1).
Wirsching argues that, intuitively, the sums of mixed powers can be seen as
accumulated non-linearities occuring when iterating the map T .
A large part of Wirsching‚Äôs book [87](1998) concerns a finer study of the
predecessor sets using the functions
el(k, a) = |{b ‚àà Z+ : T (k+l)(b) = a, k even iterates, l odd iterates}|.
Defining the nth estimating series as
sn(a) :=
‚àû‚àë
l=1
el (n + bl log2(3/2)c, a) ,
Wirsching proves the implication
lim inf
n‚Üí‚àû
sn(a)
Œ≤n
> 0 =‚áí Za(x) ‚â• C
(x
a
)log2 Œ≤
for some constant C > 0 and large x.
Since el(k, a) depends on a only through its residue class to modulo 3
l, Wirsching
considers the functions el(k, ¬∑) whose domain is Z3, the group of 3-adic integers.
Since el(k, a) = 0 whenever l ‚â• 1 and 3|a, the set {el(k, ¬∑) : l ‚â• 1, k ‚â• 0} is
a family of functions on the compact topological group Z ‚àó3 of invertible 3-adic
integers. This application of 3-adic integers to the 3x + 1 Problem was first
seen in Wirsching[86](1994), and similar analysis was also done by Applegate
12
and Lagarias[8](1995). The functions el(k, ¬∑) are integrable with respect to Z ‚àó3‚Äôs
unique normalized Haar measure, yielding the 3-adic average
e¬Øl(k) :=
‚à´
Z‚àó3
el(k, a)da =
1
2 ¬∑ 3l‚àí1
Ô£´
Ô£≠ k + l

Ô£∏ .
Several results follow with this approach, including
lim inf
n‚Üí‚àû

sn(a)da > 0,
implying that every predecessor set PT (a) with a 6‚â° 0 mod 3 has positive
density.
3 Representations of Iterates of a 3x + 1 Map
The oft-cited result in this area is due to Bo¬®hm and Sontacchi[14](1978): the
3x + 1 problem is equivalent to showing that each n ‚àà Z+ may be written as
n =
1
3m
(
2vm ‚àí
m‚àí1‚àë
k=0
3m‚àík‚àí12vk
)
where m ‚àà Z+ and 0 ‚â§ v0 < v1 < ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ vm are integers. Similar results were
obtained by Amigo¬¥[2, Prop.4.2](2001).
Sinai[70](2003) studies the function F on the set u defined as
u = {1} ‚à™ u+ ‚à™ u‚àí, u¬±1 = 6Z+ ¬± 1.
Let k1, k2, . . . , km ‚àà Z+ and  = ¬±1. Then the set of x ‚àà u to which one can
apply F (k1)F (k2) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑F (km) is an arithmetic progression
œÉ(k1,k2,...,km,) = {6 ¬∑ (2k1+k2+¬∑¬∑¬∑+km + qm) + }
for some qm such that 1 ‚â§ qm ‚â§ 2k1+k2+¬∑¬∑¬∑+km . Moreover,
F (k1)F (k2) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑F (km)(œÉ(k1,k2,...,km,)) = {6 ¬∑ (3mp + r) + Œ¥}
for some r and Œ¥ satisfying 1 ‚â§ r ‚â§ 3m, Œ¥ = ¬±1. Results in this spirit may
be found in Andrei et al.[5](2000) and Kuttler[44](1994). Sinai uses this result
13
to obtain some distributional information regarding trajectories of F . Let 1 ‚â§
m ‚â§ M , x0 ‚àà u and
œâ
(m
M
)
=
log(F (m)(x0)) ‚àí log(x0) + m(2 log 2‚àí log 3)‚àö
M
.
If 0 ‚â§ t ‚â§ 1, then œâ(t) behaves like a Wiener trajectory.
Related to these results is the connection made in Blecksmith et al.[13](1998)
between the 3x+1 problem and 3-smooth representations of numbers. A number
n ‚àà Z+ has a 3-smooth representation if and only if there exist integers {ai}
and {bi} such that
n =
k‚àë
i=1
2ai3bi , a1 > a2 > ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ > ak ‚â• 0, 0 ‚â§ b1 < b2 < ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ < bk.
Note the similarity with the terms considered by Wirsching in the last section.
These numbers were studied at least as early as Ramanujan. A 3-smooth rep-
resentation of n is special of level k if
n = 3k + 3k‚àí12a1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑+ 3 ¬∑ 2ak‚àí1 + 2ak
in which every power of 3 appears up to 3k. For a fixed k, each n has at most
one such representation ‚Äì see Lagarias[46](1990), who credits the proof to Don
Coppersmith. Blecksmith et al. then offer the reader to prove that m ‚àà Z+
iterates to 1 under C if and only if there are integers e and f such that the
positive integer n = 2e ‚àí 3fm has a special 3-smooth representation of level
k = f ‚àí 1. The choice of e and f is not unique, if it exists.
4 Reduction to Residue Classes and Other Sets
Once one is convinced that the 3x + 1 problem is true, a natural approach is
to find subsets S ‚äÇ Z+ such that proving the conjecture on S implies it is true
on Z+. It is obvious this holds if S = {x : x ‚â° 3 mod 4} since numbers in
the other residue classes decrease after one or two iterations. Puddu[63](1986)
and Cadogan[19](1984) showed that this works if S = {x : x ‚â° 1 mod 4}.
The work of Bo¬®hm and Sontacchi[14](1978) implies that m odd T -iterates of x
14

equals (3/2)m(x + 1) ‚àí 1, hence odds must eventually become even. Coupling
this with the dynamics of integers in Z 4 (see Figure 3b) implies both S = {x :
x ‚â° 1 mod 4} and S = {x : x ‚â° 2 mod 4} are sufficient. Similarly, Figure
3a indicates S = {x : x ‚â° 1 mod 3} or S = {x : x ‚â° 2 mod 3} suffice.
Andaloro[3](2000) has improved these to S = {x : x ‚â° 1 mod 16}. All of these
sets have an easily computed positive density, the lowest being Andaloro‚Äôs set
S at 1/16. Korec and Znam[40](1987) significantly improve this by showing the
sufficiency of the set S = {x : x ‚â° a mod pn} where p is an odd prime, a is a
primitive root mod p2, p 6 |a, and n ‚àà Z+. This set has density p‚àín which can be
made arbitrarily small. In a similar vein, Yang[88](1998) proved the sufficiency
of the set {
n : n ‚â° 3 + 10
3
(4k ‚àí 1) mod 22k+2
}
for any fixed k ‚àà Z+. Korec and Znam also claim to have a sufficient set with
density zero, but details were not provided. To this end, a recent result of
Monks[57](2002) is noteworthy. The last section showed how difficult it is to
find a usable closed form expression for T (k)(x). If the ‚Äú+1‚Äù was omitted from
the iterations, this would yield T (k)(x) = 3mx/2k, where m is the number of
odd terms in the first k iterations of x. Monks[57](2002) has proven that there
are infinitely many ‚Äúlinear versions‚Äù of the 3x + 1 problem. An example given
15
is the map
R(n) =
Ô£±Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≤

7n otherwise
where NOTA means ‚Äúnone of the above‚Äù conditions hold. Monks shows the
3x+1 problem is true if and only if for every positive integer n the R-orbit of 2n
contains 2. The proof uses Conway‚Äôs Fractran language[25](1987) which Conway
used [24](1972) to prove the existence of a similar map whose long-term behavior
on the integers was algorithmically undecidable. Connecting this material back
to sufficient sets, one notes that the density of the set {2n : n ‚àà Z+} is zero
(albeit, one has a much more complicated map).
5 Cycles
Studying the structure of any possible cycles of T has received much attention.
Letting ‚Ñ¶ be a cycle of T , and ‚Ñ¶odd, ‚Ñ¶even denote the odd and even terms
in ‚Ñ¶, one may rearrange the equation‚àë
x‚àà‚Ñ¶
x =
‚àë
x‚àà‚Ñ¶
T (x)
to obtain ‚àë
x‚àà‚Ñ¶even
x =
‚àë
x‚àà‚Ñ¶odd
x + |‚Ñ¶odd| .
This was noted by Chamberland[21](1999) and Monks[57](2002).
Using modular arithmetic, Figure 3 indicates the dynamics of integers under
T both in Z3 and Z4. Since no cycles may have all of its elements of the form
16
0 mod 3, 0 mod 4, or 3 mod 4, the figures imply that no integer cycles (except
{0}) have elements of the form form 0 mod 3. Also, the number of terms in
a cycle congruent to 1 mod 4 equals the number congruent to 2 mod 4. This
analysis was presented by Chamberland[21](1999).
An early cycles result concerns a special class of T -cycles called circuits. A
circuit is a cycle which may be written as k odd elements followed by l even
elements. Davison[27](1976) showed that there is a one-to-one correspondence
between circuits and solutions (k, l, h) in positive integers such that
(2k+l ‚àí 3k)h = 2l ‚àí 1. (1)
It was later shown using continued fractions and transcendental number theory
(see Steiner[71](1977), Rozier[66](1990)) that equation (1) has only the solution
(1, 1, 1). This implies that {1, 2} is the only circuit.
For general cycles of T , Bo¬®hm and Sontacchi[14](1978) showed that x ‚àà Z+
is in an n-cycle of T if and only if there are integers 0 ‚â§ v0 ‚â§ v1 ‚â§ ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚â§ vm = n
such that
x =
1
2n ‚àí 3m
m‚àí1‚àë
k=0
3m‚àík2vk
A similar result is derived by B. Seifert[68](1988).
Eliahou[30](1993) has given some strong results concerning any non-trivial
cycle ‚Ñ¶ of T . Letting ‚Ñ¶0 denote the odd terms in ‚Ñ¶, he showed
log2
(
3 +
1
M
)
‚â§ |‚Ñ¶||‚Ñ¶o| ‚â§ log2
(
3 +
1
m
)
(2)
where m and M are the smallest and largest terms in ‚Ñ¶. Note that for ‚Äúlarge‚Äù
cycles this implies
|‚Ñ¶|
|‚Ñ¶0| ‚âà log2 3.
Eliahou uses this in conjunction with the Diophantine approximation of log2 3
and the numerical bound m > 240 to show that
|‚Ñ¶| = 301994a + 17087915b + 85137581c
where a, b, c are nonnegative integers, b ‚â• 1 and ac = 0. Similar results were
found by Chisala[22](1994) and Halbeisen and Hungerbu¬®hler[35](1997). This
17
approach was pushed the farthest by Tempkin and Arteaga[75](1997). They
tighten the relations in (2) and use a better lower bound on m to obtain
|‚Ñ¶| = 187363077a + 272500658b + 357638239c
where a, b, c are nonnegative integers, b ‚â• 1 and ac = 0.
It is not apparent how the even-odd dissection of a cycle used in these results
may be extended to a finer dissection of the terms in a cycle, say, mod 4. Related
to this, Brox[17](2000) has proven that there are finitely many cycles such that
œÉ1 < 2 log(œÉ1 + œÉ3)
where œÉi equals the number of terms in a cycle congruent to i mod 4.
6 Extending T to Larger Spaces
A common problem-solving technique is to imbed a problem into a larger class
of problems and use techniques appropriate to that new space. Much work has
been done along these lines for the 3x+1 problem. The subsequent subsections
detail work done in increasingly larger spaces.
6.1 The Integers Z
The first natural extension of T is to all of Z. The definition of T suffices to
cover this case. One soon finds three new cycles: {0}, {‚àí5,‚àí7,‚àí10}, and the
long cycle
{‚àí17,‚àí25,‚àí37,‚àí55,‚àí82,‚àí41,‚àí61,‚àí91,‚àí136,‚àí68,‚àí34}.
These new cycles could also be obtained (without minus signs) if one considered
the map define T ‚Ä≤(n) = ‚àíT (‚àín), which corresponds to the ‚Äú3x ‚àí 1‚Äù problem.
It is conjectured that these cycles are all the cycles of T on Z. This problem
was considered by Seifert[68](1988).
18
6.2 Rational Numbers with Odd Denominators
Just as the study of the ‚Äú3x-1‚Äù problem of the last subsection is equivalent to
the 3x + 1 problem on Z‚àí, Lagarias[46](1990) has extended the 3x + 1 to the
rationals by considering the class of maps
Tk(x) =
Ô£±Ô£≤
Ô£≥
3x+k
2 x ‚â° 1 (mod 2)
x
2 x ‚â° 0 (mod 2)
positive k ‚â° ¬±1 mod 6 with (x, k) = 1. He has shown that cycles for Tk
correspond to rational cycles x/k for the 3x + 1 function T . Lagarias proves
there are integer cycles of Tk for infinitely many k (with estimates on the number
of cycles and bounds on their lengths) and conjectures that there are integer
cycles for all k. Halbeisen and Hungerbu¬®hler[35](1997) derived similar bounds
as Eliahou[30](1993) on cycle lengths for rational cycles.
6.3 The Ring of 2-adic Integers Z2
The next extension is to the ring Z 2 of 2-adic integers consisting of infinite
binary sequences of the form
a = a0 + a12 + a22
2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ =
‚àû‚àë
j=0
aj2
j
where aj ‚àà {0, 1} for all non-negative integers j. Congruence is defined by
a ‚â° a0 mod 2.
Chisala[22](1994) extends C to Z 2 but then restricts his attention to the
rationals. He derives interesting restrictions on rational cycles, for example, if
m is the least element of a positive rational cycle, then
m > 2
dm log2 3e
m ‚àí 3.
A more developed extension of T , initiated by Lagarias[45](1985), defines
T : Z2 ‚Üí Z2, T (a) :=
Ô£±Ô£≤
Ô£≥ a/2 if a ‚â° 0 mod 2(3a + 1)/2 if a ‚â° 1 mod 2
19
It has been shown (see Mathews and Watts[52](1984) and Mu¬®ller[59](1991))
that the extended T is surjective, not injective, infinitely many times differ-
entiable, not analytic, measure-preserving with respect to the Haar measure,
and strongly mixing. Similar results concerning iterates of T may be found in
Lagarias[45](1985), Mu¬®ller[59](1991),[60](1994) and Terras[77](1976). Defining
the shift map œÉ : Z2 ‚Üí Z2 as
œÉ(x) =
Ô£±Ô£≤
Ô£≥
x‚àí1
2 x ‚â° 1 (mod 2)
x
2 x ‚â° 0 (mod 2)
,
Lagarias[45](1985) proved that T is conjugate to œÉ via the parity vector map
Œ¶‚àí1 : Z2 ‚Üí Z2 defined by
Œ¶‚àí1(x) =
‚àû‚àë
k=0
2k (T k(x) mod 2),
that is, Œ¶ ‚ó¶ T ‚ó¶ Œ¶‚àí1 = œÉ. Bernstein[11](1994) gives an explicit formula for the
inverse conjugacy Œ¶, namely
Œ¶(2d0 + 2d1 + 2d2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑) = ‚àí1
3
2d0 ‚àí 1
9
2d1 ‚àí 1
27
2d2 ‚àí ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑
where 0 ‚â§ d0 < d1 < d2 < . . .. He also shows that the 3x + 1 problem is
equivalent to having Z+ ‚äÇ Œ¶ ( 13Z). Letting Qodd denote the set of rationals
whose reduced form has an odd denominator, Bernstein and Lagarias[12](1996)
proved that the 3x + 1 problem has no divergent orbits if Œ¶‚àí1(Qodd) ‚äÇ (Qodd).
Recent developments along these lines have been made by Monks and Yazinski[58](2002).
Since Hedlund[36](1969) proved that the automorphism group of œÉ is simply
Aut(œÉ) = {id, V }, where id is the identity map and V (x) = ‚àí1‚àíx, Monks and
Yazinski define a function ‚Ñ¶ as
‚Ñ¶ = Œ¶ ‚ó¶ V ‚ó¶ Œ¶‚àí1.
We then have that ‚Ñ¶ is the unique nontrivial autoconjugacy of the 3x+1 map, i.e.
‚Ñ¶‚ó¶T = T ‚ó¶‚Ñ¶ and ‚Ñ¶2 = id. Coupled with the results of Bernstein and Lagarias,
the authors show that three statements are equivalent: Œ¶‚àí1(Qodd) ‚äÇ (Qodd),
‚Ñ¶(Qodd) ‚äÇ (Qodd), and no rational 2-adic integer has a divergent T -trajectory.
20
Monks and Yazinski also extend the results of Eliahou[30](1993) and Lagarias[45](1985)
concerning the density of ‚Äúodd‚Äù points in an orbit. Let Œ∫n(x) denote the num-
ber of ones in the first n-digits of the parity vector x. If x ‚àà Qodd eventually
enters an n-periodic orbit, then
ln(2)
ln(3 + 1/m)
‚â§ lim
n‚Üí‚àû
Œ∫n(x)
n
‚â§ ln(2)
ln(3 + 1/M)
where m, M are the least and greatest cyclic elements in the eventual cycle. If
x ‚àà Qodd diverges, then
ln(2)
ln(3)
‚â§ lim inf
n‚Üí‚àû
Œ∫n(x)
n
.
Monks and Yazinski define another extension of T , namely Œæ : Z 2 ‚Üí Z2 as
Œæ(x) =
Ô£±Ô£≤
Ô£≥ ‚Ñ¶(x) x ‚â° 1 (mod 2)x
2 x ‚â° 0 (mod 2)
and prove that the 3x + 1 problem is equivalent to having the number one in
the Œæ-orbit of every positive.
6.4 The Gaussian Integers and Z2[i]
Joseph[38](1998) extends T further to Z2[i], defining TÀú as
TÀú (Œ±) =
Ô£±Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≤
Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≥
Œ±/2, if Œ± ‚àà [0]
(3Œ± + 1)/2, if Œ± ‚àà [1]
(3Œ± + i)/2, if Œ± ‚àà [i]
(3Œ± + 1 + i)/2, if Œ± ‚àà [1 + i]
where [x] denotes the equivalence class of x in Z 2[i]/2Z2[i]. Joseph shows that
TÀú is not conjugate to T √ó T via a Z 2-module isomorphism, but is topologically
conjugate to T √óT . Arguing akin to results of the last subsection, Joseph shows
that TÀú is chaotic (in the sense of Devaney). Kucinski[43](2000) studies cycles
of Joseph‚Äôs extension TÀú restricted to the Gaussian integers Z[i].
6.5 The Real Line lR
A further extension of T to the real line lR is interesting in that it allows
tools from the study of iterating continuous maps. In an unpublished paper,
21
Tempkin[76](1993) studies what is geometrically the simplest such extension:
the straight-line extension to the Collatz function C:
L(x) =
Ô£±Ô£≤
Ô£≥ C(x), x ‚àà ZC(bxc) + (x ‚àí bxc)(C(dxe) ‚àí C(bxc)), x 6‚àà Z
=
Ô£±Ô£≤
Ô£≥ ‚àí(5n‚àí 2)x + n(10n‚àí 3), x ‚àà [2n‚àí 1, 2n](5n + 4)x ‚àí n(10n + 7), x ‚àà [2n, 2n + 1] .
Tempkin proves that on each interval [n, n+1], n ‚àà Z+, L has periodic points of
every possible period. Capitalizing on the fact that iterates of piecewise linear
functions are piecewise linear, he also shows that every eventually periodic point
of L is rational, every rational is either eventually periodic or divergent, and
rationals of the form k/5 with k 6‚â° 0 mod 5 are divergent.
Tempkin also mentions a smooth extension to C, namely
E(x) :=
7x + 2
4
+
5x + 2
4
cos(pi(x + 1))
but conducts no specific analysis with it. Chamberland[20](1996) studies a
similar extension to T :
f(x) :=
x
2
cos2
(pix
2
)
+
3x + 1
2
sin2
(pix
2
)
= x +
1
4
‚àí 2x + 1
4
cos(pix).
Chamberland shows that any cycle on Z+ must be locally attractive. By also
showing that the Schwarzian derivative of f is negative on lR+, this implies the
long-term dynamics of almost all points coincides with the long-term dynamics
of the critical points. One quickly finds that there are two attracting cycles,
A1 := {1, 2}, A2 := {1.192531907 . . . , 2.138656335 . . .}.
Chamberland conjectures that these are the only two attractive cycles of f
on lR+. This is equivalent to the 3x + 1 problem. It is also shown that a
monitonically increasing divergent orbit exists. Chamberland compactifies the
map via the homeomorphism œÉ(x) = 1/x on [¬µ1,‚àû) (¬µ1 is the first positive
22
Figure 4: Julia set of Chamberland‚Äôs map extended to the complex plane
fixed point of the map f), yielding a dynamically equivalent map h defined on
[0, ¬µ1] as
h(x) =
Ô£±Ô£≤
Ô£≥
4x
4+x‚àí(2+x) cos(pix) , x ‚àà (0, ¬µ1]
0, x = 0
.
Lastly, Chamberland makes statements regarding any general extension of f :
it must have 3-cycle, a homoclinic orbit (snap-back repeller), and a monoton-
ically increasing divergent trajectory. To illustrate how chaos figures into this
extension, Ken Monks replaced x with z in Chamberland‚Äôs map and numerically
generated the filled-in Julia set. A portion of the set is indicated in Figure 4.
In a more recent paper, Dumont and Reiter[28](2003) produce similar results
for the real extension
f(x) :=
1
2
(
3sin
2(pix/2)x + sin2(pix/2)
)
.
The authors have produced several other extensions, as well as figures repre-
senting stopping times; see Dumont and Reiter[29](2001).
Borovkov and Pfeifer[15](2000) also show that any continuous extension of T
has periodic orbits of every period by arguing that the map is turbulent: there
exist compact intervals A1 and A2 such that A1 ‚à™ A2 = f(A1) ‚à© f(A2).
23
6.6 The Complex Plane lC
Letherman, Schleicher and Wood[50](1999) offer the next refinement of this
approach: they extend T to the complex plane with
f(z) :=
z
2
+
1
2
(1‚àí cos(piz))
(
z +
1
2
)
+
1
pi
(
1
2
‚àí cos(piz)
)
sin(piz)+h(z) sin2(piz).
Note that the first two terms (with z replaced by x) match Chamberland‚Äôs
extension. The clear dynamic advantage of this new function is that the set of
critical points on the real line is exactly Z. They improve Chamberland‚Äôs result
by showing that on [n, n + 1], with n ‚àà Z+, there is a Cantor set of points that
diverge monotonically. On the complex plane, Letherman et al. use techniques
of complex dynamics to derive results about Fatou components. In particular,
they show that no integer is in a Baker domain (domain at infinity). One
concludes then that any integer either belongs to a super-attracting periodic
orbit or a wandering domain.
7 Generalizations of 3x + 1 Dynamics
There have been many investigations of maps which have similar dynamics to
T but are not extensions of T . Here one is usually changing the function, as
opposed to last section where the space was extended.
Belaga and Mignotte[10](1998) considered the ‚Äú3x+d‚Äù problem, and conjec-
ture that for any odd d ‚â• ‚àí1 and not divisible by three, all integer orbits enter
a finite set (hence every orbit is eventually periodic). Note that the ‚Äú3x ‚àí 1‚Äù
problem is equivalent to the 3x+1 problem on the negative integers, considered
in the previous section.
Another obvious generalization is the class of ‚Äúqx+1‚Äù problems. Steiner[72,
73](1981) extended his cycle results and showed that for q = 5, there is only
one non-trivial circuit (13 ‚Üí 208 ‚Üí 13), while q = 7 has no non-trivial circuits.
Franco and Pomerance[32](1995) showed that if q is a Wieferich number2, then
some x ‚àà Z+ never iterates to one. Crandall[26](1978) conjectured that this is
2An odd integer q is called a Wieferich number if 2l(q) ‚â° 1 mod q2, where l(q) is the order
24
true for any odd q ‚â• 5. Wirsching[87](1998) offers a heuristic argument using
p-adic averages that for q ‚â• 5, the qx + 1 problem admits either a divergent
trajectory or infinitely-many different periodic orbits.
Mignosi[55](1995) looked at a related generalization, namely
TŒ≤(n) =
Ô£±Ô£≤
Ô£≥ dŒ≤ne n ‚â° 1 (mod 2)x
2 n ‚â° 0 (mod 2)
for any Œ≤ > 1 and r ‚àà lR. The case Œ≤ = 3/2 is equivalent to T . Mignosi
conjectures that for any Œ≤ > 1, there are finitely many periodic orbits. This is
proven for Œ≤ =
‚àö
2 and a hueristic argument is made that this conjecture holds
for almost all Œ≤ ‚àà (1, 2). Brocco[16](1995) modifies the map to
TŒ±,r(n) =
Ô£±Ô£≤
Ô£≥ dŒ±n + re n ‚â° 1 (mod 2)x
2 n ‚â° 0 (mod 2)
for 1 < Œ± < 2. He shows for his map that the Mignosi‚Äôs conjecture is false if the
interval ((r ‚àí 1)/(Œ± ‚àí 1), r/(Œ± ‚àí 1)) contains an odd integer and Œ± is a Salem
number or a PV number3 .
Matthews and Watts[52, 53](1984,1985) deal with multiple-branched maps
of the form
T (x) :=
mix ‚àí ri
d
, if x ‚â° i mod d
where d ‚â• 2 is an integer, m0, m1, . . . , md‚àí1 are non-zero integers, and r0, r1, rd‚àí1 ‚àà
Z such that ri ‚â° imi mod d. They mirror their earlier results (seen in the
last section) by extending this map to the ring of d-adic integers and show it
is measure-preserving with respect to the Haar measure. Information about
divergent trajectories may be found in Leigh[49](1986) and Buttsworth and
Matthews[18](1990). Ergodic properties of these maps has been studied by
Venturini[80, 82, 83](1982,1992,1997). An encapsulating result of [83](1997)
of 2 in the multiplicative group (Z/qZ). Wiefereich numbers have density one in the odd
numbers.
3A Salem number is a real algebraic number greater than 1 all of whose conjugates z satisfy
|z| ‚â§ 1, with at least one conjugate satisfying |z| = 1. A Pisot-Vijayaraghavan (PV) number
is a real algebraic number greater than 1 all of whose conjugates z satisfy |z| < 1.
25
essentially claims that the condition |m0m1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑md‚àí1| < 1 gives ‚Äúconverging‚Äù
behavior, while divergent orbits may occur if |m0m1 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑md‚àí1| > 1. A special
class of these maps ‚Äì known as Hasse functions, which are ‚Äúcloser‚Äù to the 3x+1
map T ‚Äì have been studied by Allouche[1](1979), Heppner[37](1978), Garcia
and Tal[33](1999) and Mo¬®ller[56](1978), with similar results. A recent survey
of these generalized mappings ‚Äì with many examples ‚Äì has been written by
Matthews[54](2002).
Seemingly farther removed from the 3x + 1 problem are results due to
Stolarsky[74](1998) who completely solves a problem of ‚Äúsimilar appearance.‚Äù
First, recall Beatty‚Äôs Theorem which states that if Œ±, Œ≤ > 1 are irrational and
satisfy 1/Œ± + 1/Œ≤ = 1, then the sets
A = {bnŒ±c : n ‚àà Z+}, B = {bnŒ≤c : n ‚àà Z+}
form a partition of Z+. If Œ± = œÜ := (1 +
‚àö
5)/2, we have Œ≤ = œÜ2 = (3 +
‚àö
5)/2.
Stolarsky considers the map
f(m) =
Ô£±Ô£≤
Ô£≥ dd
m
œÜ2 eœÜ2e+ 1, m ‚àà A
d mœÜ2 e, m ‚àà B
.
He proves that f admits a unique periodic orbit, namely {3, 7}. Defining b(n) =
bnŒ≤c, the set {b(k)(3) : k ‚àà Z+} ‚Äì which has density zero ‚Äì characterizes the
eventually periodic points. All other positive integers have divergent orbits.
The symbolic dynamics are simple: any trajectory has an itinerary of either
Bl(AB)‚àû or Bl(AB)kA‚àû for some integers k, l ‚â• 0.
8 Miscellaneous
Margenstern and Matiyasevich[51](1999) have encoded the 3x + 1 problem as a
logical problem using one universal quantifier and several existential quantifiers.
Specifically, they showed that T (m)(2a) = b for some m ‚àà Z+ if and only if there
exist w, p, r, s ‚àà Z+ such that a, b ‚â§ w andÔ£´

Gluck and Taylor[34](2002) have studied another ‚Äúglobal statistic‚Äù besides
the total stopping time function œÉ‚àû(n). If œÉ‚àû(a1) = p under the map C, the
authors define a function4 A as
A(a1) =
a1a2 + a2a3 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑+ apa1
a21 + a
2
2 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + a2p
.
where a2, a3, . . . , ap are the consecutive C-iterates of a1. For any odd m > 3,
they show that
9
13

7
.
Moreover, these bounds are sharp since

Gluck and Taylor also produce a normalized histogram of A for values between
220 and 220+20001, and its randomized counterpart. These two histograms bear
a resemblance, hinting at the stochastic/probabilistic approach to this problem.
